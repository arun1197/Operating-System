Two functions -> rand_helper and rm_page.
First few lines of rand_helper, I check the index of the frame and also get data
from page table. Then in the if condition I set bits to PROT_READ for the case
of no data in frame. After that I check for free frames. For the case of no data
in frames, insert random number and remove that page. For the other case just make
dirty bit and update the frame.
There's not much in rm_page, check and write to disk in the case of dirty bit and
also set entry to 0 and update the pointer.
